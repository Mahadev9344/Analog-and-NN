# Smart Skincare Assistant (drbot)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

An IoT-based Smart Skincare Assistant that provides personalized skincare recommendations by analyzing your skin and real-time environmental conditions.

This system integrates capacitive moisture sensing, spectral skin tone/oil analysis, and environmental monitoring (UV, temperature, humidity). A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) processes this data to classify skin conditions into one of 81 unique classes, delivering customized advice and product suggestions via a user-friendly web application.

## Key Features

* **Personalized Skin Analysis:** Measures skin moisture and oil levels directly.
* **Environmental Monitoring:** Actively tracks ambient UV index, temperature, and humidity to provide contextual advice.
* **AI-Powered Recommendations:** A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) classifies skin into one of 81 conditions to provide tailored routines.
* **Dynamic Tips:** Offers real-time alerts, such as "Extreme UV risk: Apply SPF 50+ sunscreen".
* **Web Interface:** A clean, browser-based UI to display sensor readings and recommendations.

## System Architecture

### Hardware Architecture
The system is centered around the ESP32.
* The Capacitive Moisture Sensor connects to an ADC pin.
* The TCS3200, DHT11, and UV sensors connect to digital GPIO pins.
* The ESP32 acquires data from all sensors and transmits it via Wi-Fi to the server for processing.

*(For the complete circuit diagram, please see Fig. 1 in the project report.)*

### Model Architecture
We use a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture is as follows:

| Layer Type | Output Shape | Activation | Additional Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Input | (3) | - | 3 input features |
| Dense | 64 | ReLU | First hidden layer |
| BatchNormalization | 64 | - | Normalizes activations |
| Dropout | 64 | - | Dropout rate 0.2 |
| Dense | 32 | ReLU | Second hidden layer |
| BatchNormalization | 32 | - | Normalizes activations |
| **Dense (Output)** | **num\_classes (81)** | **Softmax** | **Multi-class output** |

*(Based on Fig. 2 in the project report)*

## Model Performance

The FNN model was trained to classify 81 unique skin conditions based on sensor inputs. The model performs strongly with a **Test Accuracy of 94%**.

## Getting Started

### 1. Hardware Setup
Assemble the circuit as shown in the `Analog Report.pdf` (Fig. 1).
1.  Connect the Capacitive Moisture Sensor, TCS3200, DHT11, and GUVA-S12SD sensor to the specified GPIO pins on the ESP32.
2.  Power the ESP32 via its VIN pin.

### 2. Firmware
1.  Open the firmware code (located in the `/firmware` directory) using the Arduino IDE.
2.  Install the required libraries for the ESP32, DHT11, and TCS3200.
3.  Add your Wi-Fi credentials to the code.
4.  Flash the firmware to the ESP32 board.

### 3. Software (Backend & Frontend)
This project uses a Node.js backend and a React/Vite frontend.

1.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # From the root directory
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd src # or your frontend folder
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the Development Servers:**
    ```bash
    # Run the backend (from root)
    npm start # or 'node server.js'
    
    # Run the frontend (from 'src' folder)
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by Vite (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

### 4. Usage
1.  Power on the ESP32 hardware.
2.  Open the web application in your browser.
3.  Select your base skin tone from the options.
4.  Place the sensor device on your skin for approximately 5 seconds.
5.  View your real-time skin analysis (Moisture & Oil) and the personalized routine generated by the AI.
