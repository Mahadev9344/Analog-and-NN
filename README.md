In recent years, the importance of skincare has grown significantly, especially with the increasing awareness of environmental factors affecting skin health. This paper presents the design and implementation of an IoT-based Smart Skincare Assistant. The system integrates capacitive moisture sensing, spectral skin tone analysis, and environmental monitoring to provide personalized skincare recommendations. Key components include an ESP32 microcontroller, capacitive moisture sensor, TCS3200 color sensor, DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor, and UV sensor. The ESP32 transmits data to a server where a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) processes the input and classifies it into one of 81 predefined skincare classes. Each class corresponds to a unique combination of skincare product recommendations and tips. The FNN processes real-time sensor data to generate dynamic tips delivered via a mobile application. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy in skin hydration measurement and adaptive recommendations tailored to environmental conditions [1][2]. The system aims to bridge the gap between dermatological science and consumer IoT, offering a scalable solution for personalized skin health management.
